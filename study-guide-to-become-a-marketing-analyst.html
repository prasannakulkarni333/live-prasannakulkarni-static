<p>===</p>
<p>I am making this blog to share as a first thing when someone asks me how to get into <strong>Marketing Analytics / Digital Analytics</strong>? </p>
<p>I would say that Marketing Analytics is a wide field. For example, you can be a Growth Analyst, an Optimization Analyst, or an SEO Analyst. You could be creating targets, doing some funnel analysis or a lot of other things that an organization might need some help with.</p>
<p>There is also some Data Engineering and Web Pages part to analytics so it could get a little technical. </p>
<p>So it is important to know what exactly or approximately you want to do before creating a detailed study guide. Below are my recommendations for some general questions that someone might ask -</p>
<h2>What tools and technologies should I know and learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Excel/Google sheet takes anyone very far. should know vlookup and pivot table like the back of your hand</li>
<li>Visualization and dashboards using data studio/Domo/tableau etc </li>
<li>Digital analytics fundamentals - google analytics, Google AdWords, social media metrics etc</li>
<li>SQL basics at least (Joins, cases)</li>
<li>HTML/CSS/Javascript basics</li>
<li>Advanced - Python, statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these takes a really long time to master. So you need to give yourself time and have some patience. You can never be too technical, but always be </p>
<h2>How can I better my knowledge? Should I take a Coursera, Udemy etc course? How to get my hands dirty?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Courses and youtube videos are a good start. Real learning also happens on personal projects. There are multiple ways to get great content. A lot of it is also open source.</li>
<li>You can also do some personal projects. For example tag your personal website to collect GA events, build data studio dashboards for it. etc</li>
</ul>
<h2>Landing a remote gig/job</h2>
<p>Getting the foot in the door is difficult, I won't lie. Good luck and you can do it!
I think work samples will set you apart hence personal projects samples if crucial in the application. Also a personal blog, LinkedIn blogs help.</p>
<h2>Growth in the role</h2>
<p>Lots of potential. Data is the new oil. You can do reporting using starting skills. More avenues for data science (probability of a customer to respond to offer, marketing campaigns) open up as you get better with Python, SQL and statistics. You constantly have to learn something to be up to date. I think machine learning skills are going to be table stakes in 5-8 years. So one has to aim to acquire those skills as the foundations become solid. I am still learning a lot, focusing on Python from this year.</p>
<p>Also, marketing analytics is vast. But good to start from somewhere.</p>
<p>I am happy to help with any recommendations to help you in the journey even if I don't know you.</p>
